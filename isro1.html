HISTORY
</H1>
<p>
The space research activities were initiated in our country during the early 1960's, when applications using satellite were in experimental stages even in the united states.With the live transmission of Tokyo Olympic Games across the Pacific by the American Satellite, Dr. Vikram Sarabhai,the founding father of Indian Space Programme,quickly recognized the benefits of space technologies for India.
<br>
<br>
To spread the space research activities, Indian National Committee for space Research (INSCOPAR) was set up in 1962 under the Department of Atomic Energy. Subsequently,Indian Space Research Orgation (ISRO) was establish in 1969,in place of INSCOPAR. The Government of India constituted the Space Commission and established Department of Space (DOS) in september 1972. 
<br>
The next logical step was the Satellite Instructional Television Experiment (SITE),hailed as the largest sociological experiment in the world during 1975-76. This experiment benefited around 2,00,000 people, covering 2400 villages of six states and transmitted develipment oriented programmes using the American Technology Satellite (ATS-6). The credit of training 50,000 science teachers primary schools in one year goes to SITE.

ACHIEVEMENT OF ISRO
</h1>
<p>
ISRO has made India proud a numberof times since its inception in 1969. To celebrate Chandrayaan-3's landing on the Moon, let's take a look at the string of successful missions that ISRO has accomplished over the years.
<h2> 1. Aryabhata,1975</h2>
Named after the legendary Indian astronomer, Aryabhata, the Aryabhata satellite was the first Indian satellite. It was completely manufactured, designed and assembled in India. Weighing over 360 kg , the satellite was launched on April 19, 1975, by a Soviet Kosmos-3M rocket, from Volgograd Launch Station in Russia. It paved the way for other successful missions to come. 
</p>
<p><h2>2. Indian National Satellite System (INSAT) Series, 1983
</h2>
Initially launched in 1983, the INSAT series brought a revolution in the telecommunications sector in India. With nine operational communication satellite in Geo-stationary orbit, the Indian National Satellite (INSAT) system is one of the largest domestic communication satellite systems in the Asia-Pacific area . The INSAT system has over 200 corresponders and provides television transmission, satellite ,newsgathering ,social application, weather forecasting, catastrophe  warning, and search and Rescue activities.
</p>
<p>
<h2>3. GSAT Series</h2>
GSAT (Geosynchronous Satellite)
satellites are communication satellites constructed in India. These satellites are mainly utilised for digital audio ,data and video transmission. Out of many GSAT satellites launched by ISRO, 18 are still operational.
</p>
<p>
<h2>4. Chandrayan-1, 2008</h2>
It was India's first mission to moon . launched successfully on october 22 , 2008, the mission turned out to be one of the biggest scientific breakthroughs asvthe craft detected the presence of water molecules on the lunar surface . It was through Chandrayan-1 that the world got to know about water on the Moon.
</p> 
<p>
<h2> 5. Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM),2014</h2>
With the Mars Orbiter Mission , popularly known as MOM, India became the first nation to reach the red planet Mars on its first try. It was also the nation's first interplanetary mission. Mangalyaan was launched on November 5, 2013, by the PSLV-C25 rocket,from Sriharikota. With this, ISRO became the fourth space agency to successfully launch a spacecraft into orbit around Mars. DAespite having mission duration of 6 months, MOM has been in orbit for 7 years as of September 24, 2021
</p>
<p>
<h2>6. Chandrayaan-3</h2>
Chandrayaan-3 is a follow-on mission to Chandrayaan-2 to demonstrate end-to-end capability in safe landing and roving on the lunar surface. It consists of lander and Rover configuration. It was launched on 14 July 2023. The space craft entered lunar orbit on 5 August, and India became the first country to touch down near the lunar south pole at 69 degree south, the southernmost lunar landing on 23 August 2023 at 18:03 IST, made ISRO the fourth space agency to successfully land on moon, after Roscosmos, NASA and the CNSA.

<p>
<h2>Aditya L-1</H2>
ISRO embarks on a solar exploratory mission, Aditya L-1, dedicated to studying the sun from the unique vantage point of Lagrenge Point 1, showcasing country's prowess in both lunar and solar research.Launched on september2, 2023, by PSLV-C57, Aditya L-1 has escaped the sphere of Earth's influence and the spacecraft is on its intended path towards Sun-Earth Lagrange Point approximately 1.5 million km from Earth.
</p>
<h1 style="color:blue;" align="center">Future Programmes</h1>
<p>
<h2>1. Gaganyaan:The Human Space Mission of ISRO</H2>
Looking ahead,ISRO aims to take the next step in space exploration with the Gaganyaan progrem, planning to launch a crew of 2 to 3 Indian Astronauts into Low Earth Orbit (LEO) for up to 3 days before safely returning them to a predefined site in Indian waters.
<br>
Aimed at sending Indian astronauts into space, inaugural manned space mission Gaganyaan involves developing critical technologies, including a human-rated launch vehicle, life support systems, and crew management aspects. precursor missions, including integrated air drop system, and Pad Abort Test (PAT) Test vehicle flights, Gaganyaan Experimental mission, two identicle un-crewed missions precede the manned mission.
</p>
<p>
<h2>2. XPOSAT</h2>
XPOSAT (X-Ray Polarimeter Satellite) is India's first dedicated mission which will investigate bright astronomical X-ray sources in extreme conditions by using two scientific payloads capable of measuring polarimetry parameters, elucidating the degree and angle of polarization in X-ray photons of astronomical origin. Given the complex nature of emission mechanisms from celestial body like black holes, netron stars, pulsar wind nebulae, XPOSAT's Polarity measurements, by adding dimensions of polarization degree and angle alongside spectroscopic data, represent a significant avenue ahead for understanding intricacies of astronomical emission processes research.
</p>
<p>
<h2>3. SPADEX</H2>
SPADEX (Space Docking Experiment) is yet another a twin spacecraft mission dedicated to advancing orbital rendezvous, docking, and formation flying technologies, with scope of applications in human spaceflight, in-orbit satellite servicing and other proximity operations. The mission involve two mini satellites- one designated as a chaser and the other as a target, launched together as co-passengers. Operating in slightly different orbits the missions aim to docking will be demonstrated in orbit. The success of the docking experiment holds significant importance in paving the way for lunar sample return missions under future Chandrayaan missions. SPADEX is planned for launch in the third quarter of 2024.
</p>
<p>
<h2>4. India's Space Station</h2>
India's space station project is a vision of isro to establish a permanent human presence in space. Currently, the international space station is the only operational space station in the world, weighing about 450 tonnes and flying at an altitude of about 408 kilometers, to make a complete circuit of our planet in 90 minutes. It may be dicommissioned around 2030.
<br>
According to reports, the aim of the project is to launch a small module, 'smaller than ISS', of about 20 tonnes that will orbit the earth at an altitude of about 400 km, where astronauts can stay for 15-20 days and conduct microgravity experiments.
<br>
The timeline for this space station project spans the next 20 to 25 years, expected to be completed by 2035, following the successful launch of India's first manned mission Gaganyaan, which is scheduled for 2024. The space station project was announced by the former ISRO chief K Sivan in 2019, who said that it would be the next logical step after Gaganyaan and a manned moon landing by 2040. He also said that Indian Space Station would operate independently from the International Space Station, which is a collaboration of the US,Russia,Japan,Canada and Europian countries. The current Isro chief S Somnath has reitrated the commitment to build the Indian space station. However, building station is not an easy task, as it involves many technical and financial challenges.
